                <p>A snow leopard peers down from a craggy rock ledge high in the peaks of Mongolia, a country in Asia. She's on the
                lookout for a snack. The animal's spotted beige fur allows her to blend in almost completely with the rocks, making the
                cat a nearly invisible hunter. Noticing a wild goat grazing below, the feline creeps across the ledge on her silent,
                furry footpads. Then she rockets down the slope. The wild goat scrambles to escape. But with one 30-foot leap the cat
                catches up and pounces. Seconds later, she's secured her meal and looks for a place to dine.</p>

                <p>These endangered cats are nearly impossible to see—they've even earned the nickname “ghost of the mountains.” Their
                spotted coats act as cloaks of invisibility by blending into the rocky mountains of the 12 Central Asian countries where
                the cats live: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan,
                and Uzbekistan. Their range spans about two million square miles, which is about half the size of Greenland.</p>

                <p>The mountains the snow leopards call home are rugged and extremely cold in the winter. But these cats have some amazing
                body parts that make living in the area no big deal. In addition to camouflaging them, a snow leopard's soft, dense fur
                keeps it warm in the bitter cold. Their large paws work like snowshoes, letting the cat walk on snow without sinking.
                And their long, heavy tail helps them keep their balance while they're chasing prey. At night, the cats curl their tails
                around their bodies like a cozy scarf to keep warm—and to stay hidden while sleeping. (Find out 5 reasons why you'll
